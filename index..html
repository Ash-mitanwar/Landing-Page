    <h2>About Wolves</h2>
    <p>Wolves are powerful and intelligent wild canines known for their complex pack behavior, hunting skills, and haunting howls. As apex predators, wolves play a crucial role in maintaining the balance of ecosystems by keeping prey populations in check.

  <p>Wolves thrive in a variety of environments including dense forests, open plains, deserts, tundras, and mountainous regions. They are extremely adaptable creatures that can live in both harsh cold and moderate climates. A single pack‚Äôs territory can span hundreds of square miles, depending on the abundance of prey and landscape features.</p>
